# kraftFlix React App

## Project Summary

This project involves building the client-side for an app called kraftFlix using React. The objective is to complement the existing server-side code (REST API and database) by creating interface views that handle data through REST API endpoints.
kraftFlix-Client empowers users to seamlessly access information about various movies. Through a user-friendly interface, they can browse movies, view detailed information about individual films, save favorites, and manage their profile.

### Essential Views & Features:

- **Main view:** Displays all movies with their images, titles, and descriptions. Users can filter the movie list using a search feature, select a movie for more details, log out, and navigate to the Profile view.
- **Single Movie view:** Provides detailed information about a single movie, allowing users to add it to their list of favorites.
- **Login view:** Allows existing users to log in with a username and password.
- **Sign Up view:** Enables new users to register with their username, password, email, and date of birth.
- **Profile view:** Shows user registration details, favorite movies, and allows users to update their information and remove movies from their favorites.

### Optional Views & Features:

- **Actors view:** Allows users to view information about different actors.
- **Genre view:** Provides data about a genre, including name and description.
- **Director view:** Displays information about a director, such as name, bio, birth year, and example movies.
- **Additional features for Single Movie view:** Allow users to see which actors star in which movies, view more information about movies, share a movie, and display related or similar movies.
- **Additional features for Main view:** Allow users to sort movies based on different criteria.
- **Additional features for Profile, Single Movie, and Main views:** Allow users to create a "To Watch" list in addition to their "Favorite Movies" list.
